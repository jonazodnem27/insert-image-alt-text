Tired of inserting alternative text in all images in your WordPress media? Insert Image Alt Text will automatically add alt text on them.

== Description ==

Insert Image Alt Text focuses on the best user experience in optimizing their site specifically for inserting alt-text for images. For those who would apply media to their blogs, they can automatically insert alt text every time they would want to insert an image or a graphic. This is to automate the application of alt text for blog images.

Additionally, there is a feature that you can use to evaluate all pages and with one click, they can see what images do not have alt txt. The plugin will highlight images who have alt text by a green indicator over the image and for those who do not, it will display in red.

Stay tuned as it will get updated possibly often with new features.
